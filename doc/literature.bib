  abstract = {This paper describes the design of a compiler for an extended PASCAL with particular emphasis on code generation and optimization. The design objectives are: compiler reliability, code generator portability and object code efficiency.Designing a compiler to meet the above objectives usually requires compromises in the design. To achieve the objective of compiler reliability, one frequently tries to simplify the compiler design in order to reduce the complexity that must be mastered in the implementation. Unfortunately, the objective of producing efficient code conflicts with the objective of simplifying the compiler design. The design presented in this paper attempts to maximize the attainment of these objectives with minimal compromises.},
